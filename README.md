Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.
Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to train my exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. 
There is available a DATA .csv file from Netflix. They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining.

I'll delve into the Netflix data to see if I can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.
